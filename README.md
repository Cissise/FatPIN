Code for "Automatic radiotherapy treatment planning with deep functional reinforcement learning". For a more detailed description of the method, please refer to the manuscript which will be linked here after acceptance.

## Description

This code is about using reinforcement learning to automate radiation therapy planning. This code is developed based on the interaction between MATLAB R2021a and Python. The reinforcement learning environment is constructed using the MatRad toolkit(https://github.com/e0404/matRad) and the reinforcement learning model is implemented with the PyTorch deep learning framework.

## Train Model
```python
python train.py
```
